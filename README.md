***Instructions***<br/>
I encourage you to complete this assignment with minimal external assistance. While I acknowledge the efficiency AI brings in accomplishing tasks, my primary focus is on evaluating ***your knowledge, problem-solving ability, and how you apply that knowledge*** to solve the given task.

You are allowed to use AI-generated solutions, but you must be able to explain every line of code you submit. During the review, I will ask questions about your choices, such as:
*	Why did you write a specific line of code in a particular way?
*	Why didn’t you take an alternative approach?

If AI generates code that you don’t understand, remove it immediately. ***Failure to explain your code will negatively impact your evaluation.***<br/>
Follow-up questions to assess:
*	How you designed and developed your solution
*	The reasoning behind your choices
*	Your ability to debug, optimize, and structure your project

Expectations
I expect your project to meet the following ***production-ready*** standards:<br/>
✅ All requirements implemented without major bugs<br/>
✅ Proper validation and exception handling (both in backend and database)<br/>
✅ Best practices for authentication & authorization<br/>
✅ Well-structured, maintainable, and clean code<br/>
✅ Ability to test and validate the backend using tools like Postman, Swagger, or API documentation<br/>

**Assignment: Build a REST API for Customer Management – C#**<br/><br/>
***Requirements***<br/>
*	Users must be able to ***create an account*** and ***log in***.
*	All API calls must be ***authenticated***.
*	When logged in, a user can ***view, edit, and delete*** only the customers they created.
*	Implement ***two roles*** with different permission levels:
    *	***Regular users***: Can perform CRUD operations only on their own customers.
    *	***Admins***: Can perform CRUD operations on ***all users and all customer records***.
*	A customer entry must include:
    *	***Name***
    *	***Address***
    *	***Contact details***
*	API responses should be in ***JSON format***.<br/><br/>

***Additional Expectations***
*	You should be able to ***explain how REST APIs work***.
*	Demonstrate your API using functional tests that interact with the REST layer directly.
*	Write ***unit tests*** to verify the functionality.
*	Be prepared to use ***REST clients*** like Swagger, Postman or cURL for testing.
*	Use this ***private GitHub repository*** to version-control your code.
